            <p>Stay ahead of the curve with the latest makeup trends. Here's what's hot this season:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Glowy Skin</h3>
            <p>Move over, matte! Radiant, dewy skin is in. Focus on hydrating primers, luminous foundations, and liquid highlighters for that lit-from-within look.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Bold Lips</h3>
            <p>Make a statement with vibrant lip colors. Think fiery reds, deep berries, and electric oranges. A bold lip pairs perfectly with minimal eye makeup.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Graphic Eyeliner</h3>
            <p>Experiment with different eyeliner shapes and colors. Floating crease lines, negative space designs, and colorful wings are popular choices.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Fluffy Brows</h3>
            <p>Natural, brushed-up brows are still trending. Use a brow gel to set your brows in place for a full and feathery look.</p>

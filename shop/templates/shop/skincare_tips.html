            <h3>1. Cleansing</h3>
            <p>Start with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt, oil, and impurities without stripping your skin's natural moisture.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Toning</h3>
            <p>A toner can help balance your skin's pH and prepare it for the next steps. Look for toners with beneficial ingredients like hyaluronic acid or rose water.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Serums</h3>
            <p>Serums are concentrated treatments that target specific concerns like fine lines, dark spots, or dehydration. Vitamin C and retinol are popular serum ingredients.</p>
